# Diabetes Prediction using Scikit-Learn
This project is a classification-based machine learning model developed in a Jupyter Notebook to predict the onset of diabetes. The model is built using Python and the popular scikit-learn library. It follows a standard machine learning pipeline, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a person has diabetes or not, based on various diagnostic measurements.

Dataset
This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is a widely used benchmark for machine learning classification problems. The dataset contains diagnostic measurements and the target variable, which indicates whether the patient was diagnosed with diabetes.

The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.

Age: Age (years).

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Technologies and Libraries
The project is built with Python and utilizes several key libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: For data visualization.

seaborn: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

scikit-learn: For building, training, and evaluating the machine learning models.
